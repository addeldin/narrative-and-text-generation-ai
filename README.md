## Top-Level
This activity engages students in a conversation about text generation AI, namely [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), in order to prompt a deeper conversation about narrative. As an assignment, students engage with a storytelling engine based on ChatGPT, [AI Dungeon](https://beta.aidungeon.com/). Then, in class, the instructor guides a conversation about the stories students experienced, the nature of the technology AI Dungeon relies on, and the ramifications such technology might have on what we consider to be narrative.

There you will learn more about the course this activity was designed for as well as what kinds of courses this activity could be implemented into.
