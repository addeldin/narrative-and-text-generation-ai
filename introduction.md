# "Narrative and Text Generation AI"
## Top-Level
### Content
The "Narrative and Text Generation AI" activity engages students in a conversation about text generation AI, namely [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), in order to prompt a deeper conversation about the nature of narrative and the effect of technology on what we consider to be narrative. As an assignment, students engage with a storytelling engine based on ChatGPT, [AI Dungeon](https://beta.aidungeon.com/). Then, the instructor guides a conversation about the stories students experienced, the nature of the technology AI Dungeon relies on, and what ramifications such technology might have on what we consider to be narrative.

### Structure and Context
This activity was designed for a course called Narrative and Technology, which focuses on the impact of technology on narrative and the theory/study thereof. Throughout the term, students read narrative theory scholarship and interact with narratives from a variety of media, including print, film, television, interactive electronic literature, and video games.

AI is a common part of game design, e.g. a set of rules dictating the behavior of an enemy or ally in an action or adventure game. In these cases, the AI is embedded in a broader narrative structure. But what happens when the story itself is constructed via AI, in particular AI that operates stochastically and thus has no ground truth or sense of narrative structure?

The in-class conversation that this activity turns around encourages students to integrate their technical knowledge of generative pre-trained transformers used in text generation with the more humanities-oriented questions about the nature of narrative, and how our understanding of narrative changes when we consider the role of technology. .

## Implementation
While a course does not need to be so laser-focused on the intersection of narrative and technology for this activity to be an appropriate fit, it should be focused either on narrative, digital storytelling media such as video games, or how generative AI is impacting fields or concepts that traditioanlly are the domain of the humanities.

## Instructional Materials
The instructional materials for this activity include this introduction and an instructional guide, which walks through the activity and assignment structure. The instructional guide can be found in this repository as `instructional-guide.md`, which includes a more thorough explanation of the assignment leading into the class discussion, as well as the set of guiding questions used to guide student conversation.
